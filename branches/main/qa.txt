For example a result may be expressed as *concentration* or *absolute quantity*.\nNormal ranges are also related to units. The standardization of test results and respective units is an important step.\n\n### References\n[US core laboratory test codes value set](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core/ValueSet-us-core-laboratory-test-codes.html)\n'
