#### LOINC and units

LOINC codes refer to the test result, not the test method.

To successfully use LAB terminology, it is normally important to have comparable results, which means that each code should be associated with defined units. For example a result may be expressed as *concentration* or *absolute quantity*.
Normal ranges are also related to units.

Therefore, the standardization of test results and respective units is an important step.
