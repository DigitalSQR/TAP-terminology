While the most important is the content of terminology resources, the manner in which they are captured and exchanged is very important. 

Exchanging terminologies in standardized formats ensures that all players in the process - from international authors to local management and healthcare systems can integrate, process, and utilize these terminologies. 

Using standardized formats allows for the integration of multiple terminologies within spedifications, servers, or processs, eliminating the complexities of data translation or transformation.
Standardization in expressing and exchanging terminologies simplifies integration and eliminates the need for data translation between systems, enhancing efficiency and consistency.

Several formats exist, but in practice there is no standardization and every terminology provider uses their standard - Ranging from proprietary distribution formats to spreadsheets or PDF documents.

The increasing adoption of FHIR by the implementers and providers of terminology solution and content has allowed the advantages above. 
By using FHIR, organizations can accommodate a diverse range of terminologies within a unified structure. Furthermore, the FHIR ecosystem helps the tasks of managing, authoring, and distributing terminologies. This means organizations can ensure timely updates, facilitate accurate terminology mapping, and deploy efficient distribution mechanisms. 

In short, the standardization of the exchange of terminologies, using FHIR resources and ecosystem, is important for the management of the terminologies.
