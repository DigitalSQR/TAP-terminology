**Code Systems** are context-independent sets that provide a comprehensive list of standardized codes and meanings. Examples include SNOMED, LOINC, ATC, and ICD. 

**Code System Supplements** can contain extensions or translations of code displays. They provide additional context or localised meanings to existing codes in the Code Systems.

**Value Sets** are context-specific sets of values drawn from one or more Code Systems. They are used to specify a particular set of codes that are valid in a specific context.
