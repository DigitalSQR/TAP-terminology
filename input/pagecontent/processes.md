This specification provides a starting point for creating, maintaining and using technologies. 
This usually requires having a process which uses technical artifacts such as code systems, code system supplements, and value sets. Implementing a robust process is a starting point to ensure consistency, traceability, and data quality on terminology use.


### Creation / Onboarding of Terminologies, Code Systems, Code System Supplements, or Value Sets

The lifecycle of terminology assets begins with their creation or onboarding. 
The creation of terminology assets - ValueSets, CodeSystems - can be requested by a user that has a specific need, or can be advised by a governing authority or consumer e.g. a statistics board.
Having a defined process is important for addressing any request or need for new terms, code systems, supplements, or value sets.


### Changing Terminologies, Code Systems, Code System Supplements, or Value Sets

Terminologies, code systems, code system supplements, or value sets may need modifications or enhancements over time due to evolving business requirements or regulatory changes.

### Publishing

Making terminologies available to users is an important step. In more rudimentary approaches, terminologies are distributed in form of PDF, spreadsheets, or other documents. More advanced processes use structured files that assist the users/consumers to identify what has changed, or facilitate deployment to their systems.


### Using

Effective usage and management of terminologies, code systems, code system supplements, or value sets are facilitated by having a well-maintained inventory or catalog, and an understanding which terminologies are associated with which artifacts (including their versions). Understanding which systems are consuming the terminology artifacts helps manage dependencies and anticipate the impact of any changes.


#### Roles and Responsibilities

Several roles partcipate in these processes:

1. **Requester**: This role can be filled by anyone within the group/organization. They can request the creation or onboarding of a new term, code system, code system supplement, or value set as per business needs. They can also request changes to the existing terminologies, code systems, code system supplements, or value sets as per business or regulatory needs. 

2. **Terminology Owner**: The terminology owner oversees the process of deciding whether to onboard or create a new code system, code system supplement, or value set. They assess potential benefits, feasibility, and alignment with other assets and goals. Ownership can be organized by areas e.g. Lab terminology group vs Imaging terminology group.

3. **Terminology Author**: This role is responsible for updating the terminology assets - code systems, code system supplements, or value sets. This includes adding metadata and adding/removing values.

4. **Terminology Maintainer/Publisher**: This role involves the monitoring of terminology assets - identifying and rectifying any inaccuracies in terminologies. It is also responsible.

4. **Terminology User/Stakeholder**: Data architects and modelers that use or require terminologies are Users or stakeholders. While it may be impractical to track every user, scknowledging their role is important for the process.
